Activity 1:
Making the site, adding JUST THE HTML

Activity 2:
adding my spice and "personality" to the site + CSS time

lots of bootstrap added, dedicated a whole page just for that while the original stays and will be worked on separately frm Bootstrap.

Activity 4:
Original page + CSS was the only thing touched, no plans to add it into bootstrap just yet
JavaScript added into those two aforementioned pages
